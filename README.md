# Overview
An overwatch stat analysation tool

Overview is a tool that allows you to extract data from the game overwatch and display it in a readable format. <br>
You are able to compare, analyze and display data in a visual and self-explaining way.

This project is currently WIP, so features will be added gradually.
You can find a demo of the current development progress at the [overview homepage](https://overview-ow.com/)

The website is intended to be used as an [electron](https://www.electronjs.org/) application when the project is finished.
That is why optimization for web application development is used.

It is also fully responsive and works on any mobile device.
